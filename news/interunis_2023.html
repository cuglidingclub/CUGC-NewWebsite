    <h1 class="heading">Interunis 2023</h1>
    <p>The 2023 Interuniversity Competition, hosted by the Cambridge University Gliding Club from 1st to 9th July, became a thrilling saga of triumph and togetherness. As the largest event ever organized by CUGC, over 50 students from 9 universities took flight from Gransden Lodge Airfield, soaring to new heights and forging unbreakable bonds. Despite faltering weather and challenging conditions, these young aviators displayed unparalleled passion, skill, and camaraderie.</p>

    <p>The week kicked off on Saturday 1st July, as students began arriving and setting up their clubs’ gliders, while the guest instructors were briefed and checked to ensure that they could teach at the location, with the full competition flying beginning on Sunday 2nd July.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Unfortunately passing showers cut down on flying time for Monday to Wednesday, and an unexpected thunderstorm on Saturday 8th July forced an early end to the event. Nonetheless, good soaring weather on Thursday and especially Friday provided ample opportunities for both experienced students to showcase their skills and inexperienced students to learn and grow.</p>

    <p>We were also fortunate to graced by the presence of the 73-year-old Slingsby T.21b “Bluebell”, a truly vintage glider continuously owned by Cambridge Gliding Centre, with some students getting the chance to fly in it!</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Bluebell was our mainstay for instructing for many years, after she was supplied new in 1950 to Cambridge University Gliding Club (now Cambridge Gliding Club) for £587. She has racked up nearly 80000 (yes eighty thousand!) launches and something like 10500 flying hours.</figcaption>

    <h3 id="rising-together-by-competition">Rising together by competition</h3>
    <p>As is long-standing tradition, the main focus of Interunis was its Progression Cup, where students were awarded points for learning new skills, fostering an atmosphere of learning and mentorship. Many of the participants were relatively new and inexperienced, with this event being their first-time experience of flying at a ‘foreign’ airfield.</p>

    <p>The Southampton University Gliding Club emerged as the overall champions, with their students collectively showcasing remarkable progress and determination throughout the week. Not only did they win as a team, but they also witnessed individual stars shine, such as Hemanth Ramkumar, who stood out as a beacon of progress and was awarded the most points. For this achievement, they have won the privilege of hosting the Interunis 2025 – and we look forward to joining them to fly from Rivar Hill!</p>

    <h3 id="brilliant-displays-of-skill">Brilliant displays of skill</h3>
    <p>Outside of the team-focused competition, many astonishing displays of individual skill were also seen. Particularly outstanding was Aidan Clark of Imperial College London, who carved a daring path with a 167km cross-country flight to Osbournby (between Boston and Grantham) and back within 1hr 56mins in a Discus, earning 1280 points on the BGA National Ladder.</p>
    <p>Similarly, Matt Lui of Southampton University embraced the skies for an incredible 5-hour flight in a DG-100, setting his new personal record for flight duration, and achieving the BGA ‘Silver’ flight duration badge.</p>

    <h3 id="a-new-technical-soaring-contest">A new ‘technical soaring’ contest</h3>
    <p>Breaking from conventional gliding norms, a new “technical soaring” contest format was introduced to challenge pilots’ finesse in soaring. Scoring for this contest focused on maximizing climb rates within a short 50-minute window, not dissimilar to the Varsity competition format long held between the Cambridge and Oxford clubs.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Double checking you remember all the soaring contest rules before you fly.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Despite some initial confusion amongst participants, impressive performances were seen from pilots across the various teams, with particularly brilliant flights from Cambridge University’s Charlie Harris and Flavio Salvati, alongside Oxford University’s Azmi Rahman.</p>
    <h3 id="friends-before-rivals">Friends before rivals</h3>
    <p>Beyond the fervour of competition, Interunis 2023 witnessed many displays of true sportsmanship. Despite being visitors, participants extended a helping hand, selflessly assisting airfield operations and showcasing the spirit of unity.</p>
    <p>Even on the final day, as the skies darkened with unforeseen storm clouds, the heart-warming sight of close cooperation between the different universities illuminated the horizon. Rushing to keep their equipment safe from the rain, teams helped one another to pack up, embodying the true essence of the gliding community.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>In the end, Interunis 2023 transcended a mere competition; it became a canvas where dreams took flight, and young aviators painted a tapestry of passion, progress, and friendship.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>As we parted ways, our skyward spirits remain etched amongst the clouds, ready to soar once more. This event not only strengthened the ties between gliding clubs across universities, but also provided invaluable opportunities for many young pilots to learn, grow, and forge lifetime memories.</p>
