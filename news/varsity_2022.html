        <p>The 2022 Varsity Match for Gliding was held at Weston-on-the-Green Airfield from June 17th to 19th, an away game for Cambridge. It was a Cambridge win, with 584 points against Oxford’s 302.</p>

        <p>The Cambridge team consisted of Charlie B, Charlie H, Brooke, Darren and Koji, and brought the CUGC ASW19, ‘CU’. The Oxford team had Siobhan, Azmi, Saru and Adam.Competition was set to begin on the 18th after members completed check flights and site familiarisation the day prior. The day, however, did not turn out to have the best of weather, starting with intermittent light rain in the morning which got progressively heavier. After some limited flying, the day was ultimately scrapped, and competition was moved to the next day. Despite the lack of flying, the afternoon turned out to be eventful and fun, with a joint birthday celebration for Charlie B and Cecilia (who both had birthdays on that same day!) and a gliding knowledge quiz between the University members and the rest of the OGC members and visitors.</p>

        <p>Sunday 29th had better weather as forecasted. On Cambridge’s side, Charlie B started the day with a fantastic 45-minute soaring flight in CU; catching a good weather window, Charlie managed to get in five great climbs, making his flight the highest scoring flight of the day with the most cumulative height gain! Charlie H took the next flight in CU and managed a soaring flight of 34 minutes with two good climbs, despite the slightly deteriorating weather. Brooke went up next in CU; catching a better weather window, she managed a 44-minute soaring flight with three strong climbs, getting Cambridge another high-scoring flight. Darren unfortunately caught the worst part of the day, with no lift remaining at the time he launched; there was, however, the achievement of an impressive-looking circuit which got an honorary mention. On Oxford’s side, Azmi impressively got in five flights during the day in their Astir, with one particularly good soaring flight lasting 50 minutes with two good climbs; the flight was the longest flight of the day, accurately timed to be right on the limit! Siobhan also managed a great soaring flight with two good climbs despite the more challenging weather window she launched in. Saru and Adam flew with Cecilia in the OUGC K21; they unfortunately didn’t catch the better parts of the day, though still managed to get in two shorter soaring flights. Cambridge won the day 584-302.</p>
        <p>It was also notable that several of the Cambridge team got to fly in OGC’s T21 (‘Daisy’) on Sunday, with Richard Hall from OGC kindly offering to instruct the Cambridge members that were showing enthusiastic interest.</p>

        <p>Thank you to OGC for the incredible hospitality and OUGC for the amazing organization. Everyone on the Cambridge team was made to feel extremely welcome and had a great time. We look forward to Varsity 2023, which will be hosted by Cambridge at Gransden Lodge Airfield.</p>
